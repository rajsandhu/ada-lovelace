Here's an issue (and I know this is a README file but) -- I'm a bit confused about licenses.

I'm planning on reusing wikipedia text, but to do that I need to use a CC Share Alike License.
However, since I've read that a GNU license is something like a superset of a CC license,
I'll leave my license structure as is -- a CC Share Alike button on my page, and a GNU license
attached to the webpages on this repo.

This brings up an interesting issue. What if I integrate code that I **don't** want to share into a
webpage that uses **content** I do want to share. I don't know yet what to do in that situation.
And I know such discussion shouldn't go in a readme file, but whatever. I'm just... monkeying around
right now.
